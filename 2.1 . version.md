7.01.5
  - 7 : major update , 01 : minor update , 5: patch update
  - when minor or patch changes , we can shift to that easily , but when major changes it is very difficult to migrate as whole structure , coding practices changes.

^ is versions for ex: ^5.2.4 means that our code will automatically change aur auto update to the latest one. if ~ then no auto updates.
